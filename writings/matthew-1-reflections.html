  I am trying to build my relationship with God. So I have started to read the Bible regularly. I also decided that when
  I read the Bible, I would like to take notes. This writing entry is my first on this. I will be writing my notes and
  reflections on the first chapter of the book of Matthew. I would like

  Verses 1 - 17 give an outline of Jesus' generations before Him. It starts with Abraham and ends with Jesus Christ.
  Just from my reading of this section of the chapter, I have two questions. My first question is why did the list of
  generations start with Abraham? From my recollection, Abraham was called by God to be a father to many nations.
  Abraham was the one that showed great obedience to God, after God told him to sacrifice his only child, at the time,
  from Sarah his wife. Abraham had Ishmael before but Ishmael was born of Hagar. Due to reasons I would not like to
  assume, Isaac was seen as the heir of Abraham. I digress. This special calling in the life of Abraham may be the
  reason why the lineage starts with Abraham. God called him to be the father of many nations.

  The second question is what is the significance of the number 14. Verse 17 shows how the lineage of Jesus from Abraham
  can be separated into 3 distinct blocks, each of the them being the same length, which is 14. I would like to believe
  that this shows the perfection of God. God's plan is perfect and His ways are perfect.
