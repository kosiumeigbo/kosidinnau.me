      What we're concerned about is how to survive as best we can and thrive if we can. To become as whole as we can be,
      according to Jung. To find the joy we can find, according to Tillich.
    </div>
    <div>07:41</div>
    <div>
      Introduce the basics of Tillich's ontology. His philosophy of being and non-being. It is the foundation of the
      courage to be.
    </div>
    <div>09:55</div>
    <div>
      To make it in life, we need to plug in to trans-personal resources that are beyond our ego. We have to understand
      the limits of secular culture and secular therapy.
    </div>
    <div>11:35</div>
    <div>
      We all have dragon bites. Our flaws. Jung and Tillich had theirs. These are what make us humans. As we talk about
      Jung and Tillich, we need to make sure not to throw the baby out with the bath water. Great geniuses usually have
      substantial dragon bites.
    </div>
    <div>16:20</div>
    <div>
      Tillich is not going to over-estimate one's possibility. A lot of people live in manic defence and denial. They
      say things like "evil doesn't really exist", "it's all in the mind", etc.
    </div>
    <div>18:15</div>
    <div>
      Existential philosophy starts with the fundamentals of human experience i.e. what all human beings must encounter
      no matter what their culture, religion, gender, race. Tillich, as an existential philosopher, is impatient with
      abstractions for the sake of abstractions.
    </div>
    <div>19:58</div>
    <div>
      An existential philosopher is analysing the experience of being human. Some include Nietzsche, Kierkegaard,
      Heidegger.
    </div>
    <div>22:15</div>
    <div>
      Heidegger pointed at the way in which people, in their thinking, miss the most miraculous thing. Dr Robert Moore
      puts it this way: There is a primordial "fountain of being" and it just keeps flowing. If you're not depressed,
      you're gonna filled with wonder.
    </div>
    <div>24:15</div>
    <div>
      The first place we start in the philosophy of being is the "Fountain of Being". Tillich picked up on this and gets
      us to focus on this. When we focus on this, we have awareness on the power of being.
    </div>
    <div>25:10</div>
    <div>
      Having awareness of the power of being matters a lot because there is not just Being, but also Non-Being which is
      not passive but very aggresive. It attacks Being everywhere.
    </div>
    <div>26:40</div>
    <div>
      How aware am I, practically speaking, of the power of Being all around me and in me? How aware am I of the power
      and presence of Non-Being in my world and in my personality and life?
    </div>
    <div>28:50</div>
    <div>
      Tillich thinks that at the level of essence, that is the intentionality of Being, the richness and power and
      fullness of Being in its primal state, we can imagine that we should be more than we are. When we are experiencing
      the feeling that we should be more than we are, we are intuiting the idea of essence that is related to the
      fullness of the primordial power of being. There is something real that is leading us to intuit we should be more
      than this.
    </div>
    <div>31:08</div>
    <div>Tillich would say that we have that sense that something is not right.</div>
    <div>32:32</div>
    <div>
      What kinds of anxieties can be fixed and what kinds must be understood. Then what does one do at that point?
    </div>
    <div>36:21</div>
    <div>
      The first primordial polarity of human experience is the experience of self and world together. From the moment we
      open our eyes when we are born, there is a world. We have got to differentiate ourselves from the world. The
      challenge is differentiating from a merger with world, people, things but also having to figure out how to
      maintain contact with the world. There are 3 other polarities that we need to think about too.
    </div>
    <div>38:38</div>
    <div>
      There is the polarity of freedom and the polarity of destiny. Destiny in this case has to do with the givenness of
      our lives that we have no control over. For example born into a certain family, into a certain social class, into
      a certain race. We can't control these things. Things that happened to our grand parents that affect us and we
      don't even know about them. The Freedom pole which is that no matter what my Destiny, there is always freedom of
      my response to this.
    </div>
    <div>41:29</div>
    <div>
      It is possible for trauma to destroy our humanity and can affect our Freedom pole. One of the questions we need to
      ask ourselves is where in my life are the structures of destruction that are trying to destroy my humanity?
      Depression is losing your sense of freedom. Despair is when one gets the idea or conclusion that their Freedom is
      gone. Despair is a rejection of one's humanness.
    </div>
    <div>43:45</div>
    <div>
      Grandiosity tries to tell us there is no destiny pole. It tells us we have unlimited freedom. Despair will try to
      tell us it is all destiny, that there is no freedom.
    </div>
    <div>44:23</div>
    <div>
      There is the polarity of form and the polarity of dynamics. Think of it as Structure and Energy. At any level of
      being, there is always the powerful presence of form, and att he other end & at the same time, there is dynamics
      (energy flow). If one tends to over-emphasize form, they are probably on the compulsive side a.k.a., a controller.
      Form is rigidity in all its ways like social rigidity, religious rigidity, racial, class, etc. The dynamic pole is
      all about the transformative process like movement, change. Dynamics is usually akin to chaos.
    </div>
    <div>49:19</div>
    <div>
      Managing change is important, whether institutionally or in a culture or wherever. People who privilege freedom
      too much are gonna assume they can have unlimited change, in any amount of time, and it's always gonna be good.
    </div>
    <div>52:00</div>
    <div>
      There is the polarity of participation and the polarity of individualisation. We are always grounded in a systemic
      matrix, part of one's destiny and it has a form. It is easy to lose oneself in our participation. This leads to
      co-dependency. Tillich says that we all struggle with co-dependency. We need to participate. If we do not
      participate, we will get into massive anxiety. However, there is another type of anxiety one gets when they
      over-emphasize the individualisation pole. Too much autonomy is not good. It can make one crazy and you start to
      disconnect from people.
