  My family and I had just moved into our new house where we live in Enugu, Nigeria. This was around December 2015 when
  we moved in and after a few days, my mum got ill. It was a very strange illness because after her visit to the
  hospital, the doctor said she was lucky to still be alive. As a human being and someone that loves family, hearing
  that statement sort of shook me. The fact that my mother could have died that time made me scared not knowing the
  worst was yet to come.
</p>

<p>
  We all prayed and hoped she’d get better which she did for a while but the illness once again hit her stronger. She
  kept going for tests and treatments and they would work for the meantime but yet again the illness would hit even
  stronger. It was as if one step forward for her was immediately followed by two steps backward. Her vital organs kept
  failing steadily and slowly. This was the story of our lives until she passed away on the night of the 18th of October
  after a 3 year battle with this illness. She was avery brave and strong woman and I will never ever forget all she did
  for us and everybody she came in contact with while she was alive. I lost my mum at the ripe age of 44. My life has
  never been the same since then.
</p>

<p>
  All my life, I envisioned my mum and dad growing old together, reaping the fruits of their labor, seeing her
  grandchildren and by the grace of God, her great-grandchildren. I was 20 years old when she died and losing my mum at
  the age that I was at has affected me in ways I can’t even put into words but I believe this will be a teacher for the
  rest of my life. I’m gonna talk about and write down a few things the passing of my mum has shown and taught me about
  life.

    The grieving process is for the rest of your life: After the death of my mum was revealed to me and my siblings, we
    cried profusely as expected. I don’t think I’ve ever cried the way I did that time. It was and wasn’t a shock to me
    at the same time. It was a shock in the sense that I still had faith and prayers that my mum would eventually turn
    good but wasn’t a shock because her body was unrecognizable from before the illness hit her and deep down I feared
    the worst. Since then, I’ve cried in the most random of places from my university lecture theater, to the computing
    labs to a train, bus or any of the common transportation services. The thing is you can never go in thinking you’re
    not gonna cry because these tears just hit you anytime and anywhere. And then it finally hit me one day: This is how
    life will be for the rest of my life till I die. Now I’ve learnt not to hold back the tears when I feel them coming
    up because it is only natural and part of the process that’ll go on for the rest of your life. I’ve made sure to
    always remember the good times I had with my mother and know how proud of me she would be. Unsurprisingly, I’m
    crying as I’m writing this.
