    I don't remember exactly which Youtube video I was watching when this thought popped into my mind. I don't know
    whether to call it a thought or more so a contemplation. Anyway, I believe it was one of the videos from
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RichGilbert" target="_blank">Rich Gilbert</a> but I honestly cannot remember
    where. Anyway, during the course of the video, the creator mentioned something along the lines of most humans at
    some point in their life will have to give up the good for the greater good. When they said this, something hit me.
    I have a few moments in my life that relate to this saying. As I was contemplating on what I had just heard, I knew
    I had to write something down. What better way than to publish it on my website :).

    This writing is divided into three main parts. In this first part, I talk about a major act of faith that my mother
    did for me while I was still a young child. This action shaped my life and where I am today. In this second part, I
    talk about my journey learning to code and my thoughts and feelings towards job applications. In the third and final
    part, I talk about a

  <h2>Coding Journey and Job Applications</h2>
  <p>
    I've been learning to code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript/Typescript for the better part of the past two years. I've
    gone from smaller projects to bigger ones. I've learnt a lot and sometimes when I look back at how far I've come,
    I'm really amazed and proud of myself. For more context on my journey, have a look at my writing
    <a href="https://kosidinnau.me/writings/my-coding-journey-so-far-june-2023">here</a>. Now, one of the reasons I
    wanted to start learning to code was to get a job. I had friends telling me along the way that it's all good doing
    side projects and things that help me learn stuff but the truth is that if I wanted to get a job, I needed to start
    applying to jobs. And they were right to say this of course. But there were a few problems with this. For one, I was
    using the side project excuse to avoid the process of applying for jobs. I was telling myself that I just needed to
    practise more, build more side projects, watch more tutorial videos. Basically, I was telling myself to do every
    other thing except applying for jobs. I was doing everything in my power, intentionally or not, to avoid applying
    for jobs.
  </p>

  <p>
    In all honesty, I was allowing my fears to dictate my resistance to apply for jobs. Now these fears were the usual:
    I'm not good enough, no one will hire me, I don't have professional experience, etc. And looking back at it, some of
    the fears may have been valid but I should not be the one telling myself these opinions. I should always, or at
    least strive to always, believe in myself and speak life into myself. I struggle a lot with that but that is a topic
    for another day. But it was not just the fear talking. I was overwhelmed with the amount of work I'd have to put in
    to be able to get a job. With not having had a professional role as a software engineer, I was going to be facing a
    very very tough task of getting a job. Yes I may have done a couple of minor development tasks within my company but
    they were not enough to convince myself that I was ready. I was overwhelmed with the possibility of spending most of
    my time doing Leetcode and System Design. Even before that, I needed to get interviews which depended a lot on my
    CV. All in all, the main theme here is that in this context, I was fearful of doing the things I needed to do to
    find a job. One might even say that I was afraid of giving up the good for the greater good, but that is both right
    and wrong
  </p>

  <p>
    As much as I should have been applying for jobs, I also take solace in the fact that me working on my side projects
    also helped me to keep in floe, It helped me learn things that I may not have learnt if all I was doing with my time
    was applying to jobs and doing Leetcode and System Design. Now, you might say that this is cope and maybe there is
    some cope in this but the truth is I don't really regret working on my side projects. In fact, it helped me build my
    skillset and learn new things. The only additional thing I will say on this is that cold applying is not feasible
    for someone like me. I will still try but there's other ways I can go about this. The main key is fully immersing
    myself in these things. In fully immersing myself, I get involved with learning a lot more through Open Source
    contributions. This is a goal of mine that I want to achieve. So in summary, the greater good here isn't just
    stopping my side project quests and applying for jobs, but really it is all about immersing myself in the software
    world and contributing in any way I can either to my projects or to Open Source repos. Ultimately, I do want a job
    but I know there are processes that need to happen before I get there. I don't want to bring anxiety upon myself
    just thinking of getting a job as the main and only outcome, but instead have an open and inquisitive mind to learn
    and contribute in any way possible.

<!-- But the more I did code, especially in the frontend/UI side of programming in Javascript/Typescript, the more I started
to question whether this was the right path for me. And by this, I meant frontend work. Three main reasons for this.
Firstly, I began to realise that I hated CSS and the whole process of styling the page and giving it padding, margin,
etc. I will say that my eventual disdain for CSS and styling is most likely down to the fact that I do not have a
designer, like most companies do. Now would this alleviate some of my issues? Sure, I guess. But I don't think I'll ever
know for sure until I'm in the position where I do have a designer. Secondly, I started to
