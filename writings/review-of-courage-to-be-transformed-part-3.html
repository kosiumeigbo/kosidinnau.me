      This lecture has to be approached in a Tillichian way. It is existential, meaning you have to ask the question
      about how it applies to you and your life. How does it apply to my struggle to connect with being.
    </div>
    <div>1:53:29</div>
    <div>
      Ask yourself: "Where is the non-being coming at you?", "What kind of anxiety seems most present consciously?",
      "What kind of courage do you need more of?".
    </div>
    <div>1:55:20</div>
    <div>
      What are the elements of transformative process? And this would be true for individuals as well as organisations,
      cities, cultures, Earth.
    </div>
    <div>1:56:24</div>
    <div>
      The first element is Diagnosis or Diagnostics. Some people call it assessment. What is the situation here? It
      takes enormous effort. Never under-estimate how much further you have to go. There is a kind of deep knowing that
      is beyond the shallow understanding of any of the theories, and we are wired for this.
    </div>
    <div>1:57:37</div>
    <div>
      It is not pleasant to see more clearly. That is why we retreat into denial. It takes courage to be able to face
      what is happening.
    </div>
    <div>1:58:32</div>
    <div>
      If you don't know where the front is, you can't send any resources there. We need to crank up the magician
      (represents transformation, wisdom and the ability to manifest dreams into reality through hidden knowledge and
      insight). This has got a lot to do with strategy and healing.
    </div>
    <div>1:59:00</div>
    <div>
      If you really feel like this close to drowning, you're not going to be able to figure out where you want to go.
      You won't be able to have a vision of where you want to go. At this point, don't try to create a vision yet.
    </div>
    <div>2:00:00</div>
    <div>
      The elements of transformation are Diagnosis, Vision (for where you need to go), Courage (to take action to get
      there) and the Energy to feel the courage. We cannot neglect any of these four elements.
    </div>
    <div>2:00:43</div>
    <div>
      You have got to locate where you are, what is happening. Even if you're really struggling, the best place to move
      is into increasing the awareness of where am I.
    </div>
    <div>2:02:16</div>
    <div>
      There is a shape of psychopathology. It is patterned. If you put some energy into studying it, you can figure out
      what is going wrong with you and why. What is the weak link in my inner chains.
    </div>
    <div>2:03:35</div>
    <div>
      If we are going to help ourselves or we are going to help other people, we need to have maps. We have to map the
      way things go wrong.
    </div>
    <div>2:04:09</div>
    <div>It is not enough to know what is wrong with you.</div>
    <div>2:05:02</div>
    <div>
      Contemporary psychiatry is making the mistake of privileging the destiny pole (it is all chemistry and
      hereditary). They emphasize giving pills.
